                  <h2><strong>Compatability Testing</strong></h2>

                  <p>Compatability testing informs the users of the platforms suitable to run Anima V3. As Anima V3 is a Windows desktop application
                    build with .NET framework (WPF - Windows Presentation Foundation), it is only compatible with Windows OS. Hence, different versions of Windows OS were tested to ensure compatability.
                  </p>

                  <h3>How was this test conducted?</h3>
                  <p>We used a virtual machine to simulate different version of windows system. We chose Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and Windows 11 as the target test environment. Original system images (iso) were downloaded from the official Microsoft website (except for Windows 11 as we already had access to it). 
                    Since the support of Windows XP and Windows 7 has been ended, these two system images were downloaded from third-party archive websites. All system images used are original to simulate new installed system environment, making sure that no extra library is already in the system.
                    Usually, if a library is not installed but required to run the software, the relevant debug message will be told to install it. By following these system messages, required libraries were figured out in different system</p>

                  <h2><strong>Performance/Stress Testing</strong></h2>
                  <p>Stress testing is required to know the bounds of our application. We need to identify the inputs that don't work with our application
                    so that we can inform the users about it. We also need to know performance of the application under different loads. Hence we are testing for these 
                    conditions here.
                  </p>
                  <h3>How was the test for checking input types conducted?</h3>
                  <p>In the Text-to-Speech section, a commonly used 104-key keyboard is used to test text input. Each key on the keyboard was typed 
                    into textfield, and then TTS was run by clicking the SPEAK button to see if there is any unsupported character error on backend output.

                  <h3>How was the test for checking peformance under different loads conducted?</h3>
                  <p>In the Text-to-Speech section, texts with varying number of words were tested to see how long it takes for Anima V3 to create speech.
                    To increase the length of text, the same sentence was repeated multiple times. The sentece being "The sun sets, painting the sky in hues of orange.' was duplicated for increasing the word count."
                    The test was conducted by running the TTS for the same sentence with increasing word count and recording the time taken for the TTS to complete.
                  </p>

                <p>As seen rom the graph, the cost of converting text to speech increases almost linearly as the number of words that needs to be spoken increases.
                    This is expected as the time taken to convert text to speech should be directly proportional to the number of words in the text.

                          friends and TA's. We have asked their opinoin on the design and functionality of the application. We have also asked them to perform certain tasks and observed their interaction with the application.

                      <h3>The Initial Design</h3>
                      <p>With this finished design, we got really good feedback. Most users feedback were positive, especially on aesthetics on ease of navigation. They have also
                        mentioned that the functionalities of the application are clear and work as intended. However, when we asked them to perform certain tasks, such as banking another voice,
                        importing a new voice while they are in the bank a voice window, they have struggled to find their way through. Hence, we have realized that the design should be highlighting 
                        3 main windows of the application, which are bank a voice, manage voicebanks and text to speech and make the transitions between them easier. Therefore we added
                        buttons on the top-right corner of each window the remind users of the other windows and make the transitions between them seamless.
                      </p>

                    </div><!-- End Portfolio Item --> 
                    <h3>The Improvement</h3>
                    <p>We have seen that the new design was much easier for our users to navigate however this time many of our users were fixated on the color palette that we 
                      have chosen for our application. They have said that the colors were too bright and the lack of contrast between the background and buttons make them seem ugly.
                      They have also reported a bug where if you bank a voice with a username that is already taken, the application crashes. Hence, we have added a failsafe that 
                      checks all names before the user can bank a voice and informs the user if the name is already taken. We have also changed our color palette to darker colors as well
                      as making the font weight of the text on the buttons bolder to increase the contrast between the background and the buttons.
                    </p>

                  <h3>The Final Design</h3>
                  <p>With the final design, we haven't heard compilaints so far. We are very happy with how Anima V3 turned out and we hope that it satisfies our real users!</p>
